> `lazyfeed` is a personal project, and the features I will be working on are tailored to my own needs and preferences at the moment.

## Motivation

I wanted a simple and fast way to follow RSS feeds directly in my terminal, without relying on services like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) or similar platforms. While existing tools like [newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat) and [nom](https://github.com/guyfedwards/nom) are available and there are more mature, I wanted to create my own, and here it is.

## Install

There are several ways to install `lazyfeed`:

### Via `pip`

```bash
pip install lazyfeed
```

### Via [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

```bash
pipx install lazyfeed

```

### Via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```bash
uv tool add lazyfeed

# Or

uvx lazyfeed
```

## Usage

> For a better experience using a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) is recommended.

```bash
lazyfeed add https://dnlzrgz.com/rss # Add a feed.
lazyfeed add https://dnlzrgz.com/rss https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml # Add multiple feeds at once.
lazyfeed import feeds.opml # Import from an OPML file.
lazyfeed # Start the TUI
```

> In addition to importing, you can also export all your feeds using the export command. Run `lazyfeed export --help` for more information.

## Configuration

If you need to, you can customize some aspects of `lazyfeed` via the `config.toml` file located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lazyfeed/config.toml`. This file is generated the first time you run `lazyfeed` and looks something like this:

```config.toml
# Welcome! This is the configuration file for lazyfeed.

[client]
# Maximum times (in seconds) to wait for all request operations.
timeout = 300

# Timeout for establishing a connection.
connect_timeout = 10

[client.headers]
# This section defines the HTTP headers that will be sent with
# each request.
User-Agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/128.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
Accept = "gzip, deflate, br"
Accept-Language = "en-US,en;q=0.6"
Accept-Encoding = "gzip, deflate, br"
```

> This folder will also contain the SQLite database where all the data will be stored.

To open the `config.toml` file, you can just run the following command:

```bash
lazyfeed config
```
